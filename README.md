# MAME Utility

The MAME Utility is a comprehensive Windows desktop application designed to manage the full driver information of the MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) in XML format, which is available on the [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/release.html) website. It can generate multiple simplified (and smaller) XML subsets and can also copy ROMs and image files based on the generated XML.  
The tool is built using C#, the WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) framework, and the .NET Core framework.

## Features

- **MAME List Generation**: Users can create simplified lists of MAME games, including full lists, manufacturer-specific lists, year-specific lists, and source file-specific lists.
- **List Merging**: Combines multiple XML lists into a single, consolidated list. This is particularly useful for users who maintain separate lists for different categories or purposes and wish to unify them.
- **ROM Management**: Allows copying of ROMs from a source directory to a destination directory based on game information contained in specified XML files. This feature simplifies the process of organizing and managing MAME ROM collections.
- **Image Management**: Similar to ROM management, this feature facilitates copying of game images (e.g., screenshots, marquee images) from a source directory to a destination directory, guided by game information in XML files.
- **Progress Tracking**: The application includes a progress bar that provides visual feedback during long-running operations, helping users stay informed about the process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 7 or later.
- .NET Core runtime installed.
- MAME ROMs and images you wish to manage.
- The MAME full driver information in XML format (available from the official [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/release.html) website).

## Usage

Upon launching the MAME Utility, users are greeted by a straightforward interface divided into sections for each of its core functionalities:

1. **Generate Lists**: Create a full list, manufacturer list, year list, or source file list of MAME games.
2. **Merge Lists**: Select multiple XML files to merge into a single file.
3. **Copy ROMs/Images**: Choose the source and destination directories, along with the XML files containing ROM or image information, to copy the corresponding files.
